The objective is to identify a business, analyze its existing loyalty program, and offer recommendations for improvement.
## Business Context
"Suki Teenoi" is considered a popular and rapidly growing sukiyaki restaurant. Despite the COVID-19 situation, its revenue and profitability remain strong. In the year 2022, Suki Tienoi has been in operation for 5 years, with a total of 42 branches under the Suki Teenoi brand, an increase from 36 branches in 2021. The branches are located in Bangkok and its surrounding provinces. The restaurant aims to meet the demands of buffet-style sukiyaki lovers by providing high-quality, delicious food at a reasonable price. Currently, Suki Teenoi offers its buffet at 219 baht per person.
  
Currently, Suki Teenoi has a loyalty program in the form of a membership card for devoted fans. The accumulation condition is earning 1 point for each visit to the shop, and once 15 points have been accumulated, customers receive a membership card. The exclusive privilege of the membership card allows for a 50% discount on food when dining in the birth month. This privilege extends to the cardholder and one accompanying person.

## Problem Statement
Suki Teenoi is facing challenges to increase customer lifetime value due to:
1. Lack of customer insights:
   - The loyalty program is not well-known, resulting in fewer sign-ups and an inability to gather customer data.
   - The loyalty program offers limited privileges, currently only providing discounts on birthdays, thus lacking incentives for enrollment.
2. Dependency on visit frequency for growth:
   - The only way to increase customer lifetime value is by increasing the number of visits since the products are priced at a fixed amount of 219 THB.
